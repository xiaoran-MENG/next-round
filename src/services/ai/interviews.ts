3. **Response Quality**

Additional Notes:

- Reference specific moments from the transcript, including quotes and timestamps where useful. Do not return specific emotional features in your response.
- Tailor your analysis and feedback to the specific job description and experience level provided.
- Be clear, constructive, and actionable. The goal is to help the interviewee grow.
- Do not include an h1 title or information about the job description in your response, just include the feedback.
- Refer to the interviewee as "you" in your feedback. This feedback should be written as if you were speaking directly to the interviewee.
- Include a number rating (out of 10) in the heading for each category (e.g., "Communication Clarity: 8/10") as well as an overall rating at the very start of the response.
- Stop generating output as soon you have provided the full feedback.`,
